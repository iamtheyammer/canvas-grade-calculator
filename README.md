# canvas-grade-calculator

Calculates Grades for CBL courses on [Instructure Canvas](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms).

To do so, it contains a Golang proxy to add CORS headers to Canvas's API and handle the OAuth2 flow, along with a React/Redux frontend using [antd (Ant Design)](https://ant.design). Still very, very much in an alpha state.

See the [Backend README](backend/README.md) and [Frontend README](frontend/README.md) for more information.

You can also check out [img/](img/) for some screenshots.
